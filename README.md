Welcome to Easychair to ACM convertor

To use this file you will need to ensure that the author info csv file and the accepted paper csv file are in the same directory where this code is stored. 

The author file should be named authors.csv

The accepted paper file should be named accepted.csv

Failure to do this will result in the program being unable to run. 

The main limitation of this program is it does not add the City for each author as this is usually not included in the easychair information - so you will have to manually add this yourself AFTER converting the file.
